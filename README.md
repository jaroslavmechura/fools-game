## Game Description
**Fools Game** is a 2D top-down shooter inspired by titles like *Hotline Miami* and *OTXO*.  
It’s a fast-paced, adrenaline-driven game with a revenge-driven storyline.  
Players take control of a character navigating through waves of enemies, using cover, tactics, and precise shooting.  
Each level is designed to challenge reflexes and strategic thinking.  
The game combines dynamic gameplay with visually appealing pixel art and smooth animations.

## My Contributions
I worked on almost every aspect of the game except music, voiceovers, and some sound effects:  
- **Gameplay and logic:** character movement, shooting mechanics, weapon system (different weapon types, ammo, shooting mechanics), health and damage systems, environment interactions.  
- **Enemy AI:** enemy behavior, reactions to the player, various movement and attack patterns.  
- **Effects and animations:** shooting effects, hit and explosion visuals, integrating character and enemy animations, smooth animation transitions.  
- **Graphics:** pixel art for characters and environment, level design, visual consistency.  
- **System integration:** connecting gameplay, animations, effects, and AI into a playable and cohesive experience.
